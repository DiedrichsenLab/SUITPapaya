## SUITpapaya
is a project by the Diedrichsen lab to build an html-based viewer for atlas data for the human cerebellum in SUIT or MNI space, including interactive visualization on the cerebellar flatmap. 
It is heavily based on (and forked from) rii-mango/Papaya (https://github.com/rii-mango/Papaya/wiki/Supported-Formats)
The package was mostly written by Da Zhi in 2019
